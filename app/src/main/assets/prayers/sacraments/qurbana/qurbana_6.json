O Lord, let me not be condemned by the reception of Thy holy mysteries. But by becoming worthy of the fellowship with Thy Holy spirit, let me find portion and inheritance with all the righteous ones, from the beginning of the world. I will offer up praise and thanks giving to Thee, and to Thy only begotten Son, and to Thy Spirit all-holy, good, adorable and life giving, con-substantial with Thee, now and at all times, for ever. Amen.",
